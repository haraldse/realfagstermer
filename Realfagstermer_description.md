# Realfagstermer [Science subject terms]

Realfagstermer is a multilingual, controlled vocabulary of pre-coordinated subject headings. It's maintained by the University of Oslo Science Library in collaboration with the University of Bergen Science Library, and covers mainly the physical sciences, mathematics and computer science. As of October 2014, the vocabulary consists of approximately 15 000 single concept headings, and about 15 000 compound headings ("subject strings"), published as open data for everyone to use freely.

The headings are grouped into four types: topical, geographical, chronological and genre/form. For each heading, at least a unique identifier and a preferred term in Norwegian Bokm√•l are specified. In addition, each heading may have preferred terms in other languages, alternative terms (synonyms, acronyms) in one or more languages, classification codes (DDC or MSC), references to related terms ('see also'), notes (for internal use) and definitions (for the end user). Realfagstermer has no hierarchical relationships at present.

As of October 2014, roughly 12% of the vocabulary has been translated into English. While continuing the translation to English, we have also applied for funding to make a complete translation to Nynorsk.

## Taking control

Realfagstermer is a young vocabulary, initiated in 2009 during the early process of consolidating the former institute libraries into a new science library. Formerly, the indexing had been based on free keywords, and with different collections coming together there was a need for better control and consistency.

The initial project group based its work on the free keywords previously used, and set the stage for a comprehensive review of these. The review was done by the subject specialists for each institute collection. Accepted, and, if needed, corrected headings were re-applied to bibliographic entries in a field for controlled subject headings. Approximately 80 000 records were furnished with controlled subject headings retrospectively.

In spring 2011, Realfagstermer was put in use as the Science library vocabulary. To maintain Realfagstermer we use the locally crafted software Roald for indexing and Sonja for editorial work.

## Reaching out

In 2012-2013 we did a project together with NTNU comparing Realfagstermer to their vocabulary Tekord, which resulted in a crosswalk between the two vocabularies covering around 20% of each vocabulary. The project was supported by the National Library of Norway.

About the same time University of Bergen Science Library adopted Realfagstermer for the indexing of their collections, using the indexing software Roald from the summer of 2014, and they also joined the editorial group.

In 2013-2014 we did a project on mapping the Dewey classification system, which resulted in about the same number of mappings as did the earlier mentioned Tekord project. The project was supported by the National Library of Norway.

We believe that the need for controlled, Norwegian science terminology extends far beyond the library field. Through the publication of Realfagstermer as open data, the vocabulary can also be used by others.

Since 2014 we've been part of a project together with the Humanities and Social Sciences Library and the National Library, looking into the possibilities for establishing a general, Norwegian thesaurus based on Humord, Realfagstermer and other vocabularies.
