Realfagstermer [Science Terms]

Realfagstermer is a controlled, pre-coordinated subject vocabulary which mainly covers the physical sciences, mathematics and computer science. Subject headings are published as open data. Per October 2014 the vocabulary consists of approximately 15 000 headings, which can be used alone or in subject strings.
Headings are grouped into four kinds: content descriptive headings, and headings for genre/form, place and time. Each heading consists of at least one unique identifier and a preferred term. In addition, the headings may have synonyms, translations and / or acronyms, classification codes (DDC or MSC), see also references, notes (for internal use) and definitions (intended for the end user). Realfagstermer has no hierarchical relationships at present.

Roughly 12% of the vocabulary has been translated into English (per October 2014). One has applied for fundings to make a complete nynorsk version.

From chaos to control

Realfagstermer is a young vocabulary, made by the Science library at the University of Oslo. The old institute libraries used free keywords, which provided neither good accuracy nor completeness [det står stille for meg her, det jegleter etter er den engelske varianten av presisjon og fullstendighet. Skjønt for den saks skyld kan alt bak komma sløyfes] of the recovery. In 2009 a group to work on developing a controlled vocabulary was established.

The project group based its work on the uncontrolled keywords previously used, and set the stage for a comprehensive review of these. The review was done by the discipline specialists for each institute collection. Accepted, and, if needed, corrected headings were re-applied to bibliographic entries in a field for controlled subject headings. Approximately 80 000 records were furnished with controlled subject headings retrospectively.

In spring 2011, Realfagstermer was put in use. The editors are still working to weed out bad terms, merging terms, and generally improve the quality of the vocabulary.

To maintain Realfagstermer we use the locally created programs Roald for indexing and Sonja for editorial work.

Out in the world

In 2012-2013 we did a project together with NTNU comparing Realfagstermer to their vocabulary Tekord, which resulted in a crosswalk between the two vocabularies covering around 20% of each vocabulary. The project was supported by the Norwegian national library.

About the same time Bergen University Library adopted Realfagstermer for the indexing of their collections. From the summer of 2014 also Bergen University Science Library uses the indexing program Roald. The library is also represented in the editor group.

In 2013-2014 we did a project on mapping the Dewey classification system, which resulted in about the same number of mappings as did the earlier mentioned Tekord project. The project was supported by the Norwegian national library.

We believe that the need for controlled, Norwegian terminology extends far beyond the library field. Through the publication of Realfagstermer as RDF / SKOS, the vocabulary can also be used by other Internet services.

Since its establishment, it has been a goal to integrate Realfagstermer into the second major subject vocabulary of the University of Oslo library; Humord. Along with the Humanities and Social Sciences Library and the National Library, we now see the possibility of establishing a general, Norwegian thesaurus based on Humord.
